# Gender Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates gender classification using a deep learning model. Given an image or live feed from a camera, the model detects faces and predicts the gender of each detected face.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment (if applicable):

   ```shell
   source/bin/activate
   ```
## Key Points

- Deep learning model is used for gender classification.
- The dataset used for training the model is not publicly available. For access to the dataset, please contact the project owner via email at gautamnegi0202@protonmail.com.
- The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80%, but it can be further improved with additional training data and fine-tuning.


## Usage

Run the main Python file:

```shell
python main.py
```

## Video Inputs and Live Feed

To use video inputs or live feed from a camera, simply run the code or you can update the code according to your specific needs. Please refer to the relevant sections of the code and make the necessary modifications.
